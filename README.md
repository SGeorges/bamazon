# Bamazon
***

The Bamazon Node application allows the user to set up a database on mysql, and provides two seperate .js files which grant the user customer or manager privileges to the mysql database. 

The customer is enabled the ability to buy items from the database (if the stock is available) and is then told the cost associated. 

The manager is enabled the ability to view the entire database, view all entries in the database with a low (less than 5) stock, to add to the quantity of an existing entry, and to add a new entry to the database.
